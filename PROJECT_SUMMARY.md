## üìã Implementation Roadmap

The project is broken down into **15 clear, actionable steps**:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-3)

1. Set up project structure and development environment
2. Create Discord bot application and get bot token
3. Set up PostgreSQL database schema

### Phase 2: Core Bot (Steps 4-6)

4. Implement core Discord bot framework with discord.py
5. Create user registration and task management commands
6. Implement daily reminder scheduling system

### Phase 3: AI Integration (Steps 7-9)

7. Build image upload and GPT Vision verification system
8. Integrate OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for conversational responses
9. Implement streak tracking and statistics

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Steps 10-12)

10. Create Docker configuration for containerized deployment
11. Add error handling and logging
12. Write configuration management for API keys and settings

### Phase 5: Launch (Steps 13-15)

13. Create user documentation and command help system
14. Test bot functionality and edge cases
15. Prepare deployment instructions and environment setup
