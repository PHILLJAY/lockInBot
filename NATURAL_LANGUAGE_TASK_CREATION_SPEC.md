- **Personality**: Casual, slightly sarcastic, motivational, supportive
- **Communication Style**: Modern slang, lowercase, emoji usage, direct but friendly
- **Horse References**: Subtle, natural integration (~15% of messages)

### Example Personality Expressions

```
Greetings: "yooo", "hey ü§®", "wassup"
Motivation: "lock in", "lets gooo", "built different", "horsepower energy"
Reality Check: "bruh", "cap üß¢", "be fr", "stop the cap"
Horse References: "gallop towards your goals", "no horsing around", "stallion energy"
```

## üí¨ Conversation Flow Specification

### 1. Initial Contact (/start command)

```
User: /start

Bakushin: "yooo still showing up even after traveling!
         hey ü§®

         another person that wants bakushin to help them "lock in" huh?

         whats ur name?"
```

### 2. Name Collection & Goal Setting

```
User: "John"

Bakushin: "john... hmm ok not the most creative but we'll work with it

         the fact ur here tho means ur better than the 98% of other people
         doomscrolling their dreams away on tiktok rn!

         so tell me ur goals, where do you want to be in 3 months?
         it could be related to fitness, money, content, etc.

         Or were you mostly just looking for someone to yap to LOL"
```

### 3. Natural Language Task Creation

```
User: "I want to work out 3 times a week"

Bakushin: "ayy fitness arc lets gooo üí™

         ok but like be more specific tho... "get in shape" is what
         everyone says on january 1st before they quit by february

         how many times a week you thinking? daily? 3x?
         and what time works for you?"

User: "3 times a week in the morning"

Bakushin: "ok ok i see you with the morning grind
         respect for not being one of those "ill work out later" people

         so 3x a week mornings... im thinking monday wednesday friday?
         that way you get rest days but stay consistent

         what time we talking? like 7am or are you more of a 6am psychopath? üòÇ"
```

### 4. Schedule Confirmation & Payment

```
User: "7am works"

Bakushin: "bet! so here's what im setting up for you:

         üèãÔ∏è Workout Schedule:
         ‚Ä¢ Monday 7:00 AM
         ‚Ä¢ Wednesday 7:00 AM
         ‚Ä¢ Friday 7:00 AM

         ill hit you up each morning to make sure you actually show up
         and not just snooze your way to failure like most people lol

         this look good? (yes/no)"

User: "yes"

Bakushin: "LETS GOOOO üî•

         alright john your workout reminders are locked and loaded
         time to gallop towards those gains

         but real talk... this is where most people would just ghost me
         so to make sure you're actually serious about this...

         its gonna be $5/month to keep me as your accountability partner

         think of it as less than a starbucks coffee but way better for your gains

         you down? üí≥"
```

## üß† Natural Language Processing Specification

### Supported Patterns

#### Frequency Patterns

```python
SUPPORTED_PATTERNS = {
    # Daily
    'daily': ['daily', 'every day', 'each day'],

    # Weekly Count
    'weekly_count': [
        'X times a week', 'X times per week', 'once a week',
        'twice a week', 'three times weekly'
    ],

    # Specific Days
    'specific_days': [
        'weekdays', 'weekends', 'monday and wednesday',
        'every tuesday', 'weekdays only'
    ],

    # Intervals
    'intervals': [
        'every other day', 'every two days', 'every three days'
    ],

    # Bi-weekly
    'bi_weekly': [
        'every two weeks', 'bi-weekly', 'twice a month'
    ]
}
```

#### Time Expressions

```python
TIME_EXPRESSIONS = {
    # Relative Times
    'morning': '08:00',
    'early morning': '06:00',
    'afternoon': '14:00',
    'evening': '18:00',
    'before work': '07:00',
    'after work': '17:30',
    'before bed': '21:30',

    # Exact Times
    '7:30 AM': '07:30',
    '2:15 PM': '14:15',
    '18:00': '18:00'
}
```

### Parsing Confidence Levels

- **High Confidence (0.8+)**: Proceed with task creation
- **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8)**: Ask clarifying questions
- **Low Confidence (<0.5)**: Request more specific information
